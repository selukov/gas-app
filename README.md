# This is a template for Google Apps Script projects.

## To get started, execute the following commands.

– retrieves the ~/.clasprc.json file with the key.
   ```bash
   npm run glogin
   ```
– creates a project; in the console, select 'form'.

   ```bash
   npm run gcreate
   ```
After executing the gcreate command, you will find files in the 'appsscript' directory. Copy the .clasp.json file to the project's root.


## The project was created using the following console commands:

1. Initializes a `package.json` file in the current directory with default values.
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Installs the Parcel package as a development dependency for your project.
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev parcel
   ```

3. Starts the project. Typically used to run the "start" script from the "scripts" section in the `package.json` file.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Installs the Vue.js package for your project.
   ```bash
   npm install vue
   ```

5. Installs the @google/clasp package for working with Google Apps Script from the command line.
   ```bash
   npm install -D @google/clasp
   ```

6. [TypeScript Documentation with @google/clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp/blob/master/docs/typescript.md): Link to documentation on using TypeScript with @google/clasp.

7. Installs TypeScript types for Google Apps Script.
   ```bash
   npm i -D @types/google-apps-script
   ```

8. Installs the nodemon package for automatic server reloading when files change in development mode.
   ```bash
   npm install -D nodemon
   ```

9. Installs Prettier for code formatting. The `--save-dev` option adds it to development dependencies, and `--save-exact` keeps exact versions in the `package.json` file.
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
   ```
